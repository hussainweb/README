Hi, I am [**Hussain**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hussainweb/), an **Engineering Manager** at [Axelerant](https://www.axelerant.com/) who is learning the ropes of working more and more with people rather than machines. I am an introvert pushing myself towards extroversion by speaking at conferences, organising meetups, and pushing myself to introduce myself to others at meetups and conferences. I have worked with a variety of technologies and spent a significant portion of my career on Drupal project and Drupal community along with the wider PHP ecosystem and technology in general.

I stress on learning fundamentals and theory but balanced with a healthy dose of pragmatism. I care about you as a person first and firmly believe that your well being comes before any work or cause. I try to be nice but not at the expense of being honest. I believe in giving feedback that needs to be heard rather than that which needs to be said. I think it is more important to be kind rather than being right.

Thanks to my employer and the Drupal project, I travel quite a bit, which I love. I also enjoying trying out different cuisines, taking photographs of places, people, and food wherever I go, and writing about all of that, if possible. I [tweet a lot](https://twitter.com/hussainweb) and [Instagram a bit](https://www.instagram.com/hussain.web/). I am usually **hussainweb** online everywhere.

## About this document

This document is my personal readme which describes a little bit about me, my values, and what you can expect when you talk to me. This document is inspired by [Matt Newkirk's article on sharing your manager readme](https://matthewnewkirk.com/2017/09/20/share-your-manager-readme/). I have extended the idea to be more holistic as a person rather than just a manager. If this idea helps or hampers the brevity of this readme (which IMHO is very important in communication) remains to be seen. Please share feedback by [tweeting at me](https://twitter.com/hussainweb).
